## Executive Summary
In the 2025 New York mayoral election, 34‑year‑old, Muslim, Indian‑Ugandan‑origin candidate Zohran Mamdani won with just over 50% of the vote, defeating former governor Andrew Cuomo and Republican Curtis Sliwa. The election, held on 4 November with early voting from 25 October to 2 November, saw more than 735,000 early voters and a turnout exceeding two million—the highest in five decades. Mamdani’s campaign, backed by 104,000 volunteers and a progressive platform of free public transit, rent control, and increased taxes on the wealthiest, positioned him as a poll‑favorite and the city’s first Muslim mayor. Trump blamed Republicans for the loss, citing his absence from the ballot, while Mamdani’s victory was framed as a message to Trump and a call for greater worker protections and immigrant solidarity.
